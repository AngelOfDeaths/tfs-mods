		Basically, this script does same thing like "globalSaveEnabled" in TFS
			with addition that this one can be configured to make few global saves per day (unlimited amount)
			plus, this one is written as a lua script, so you can modify it easier
			WARNING: it works only with shutdown option

		** Scroll down to add your own saves! **
